# 🚀 Managed Agent X · Node.js SDK

> 🔥 **In 2027, if you're still building your own Agent Harness and maintaining a ReAct loop, you're already behind at the starting line.**

## One SDK to manage cloud-hosted agents

Our goal is to manage **Managed Agents across providers** from Java, Python, or Node.js. Use the same calls to select an agent, submit input, and read output. Session continuation, event replay, and approvals depend on the provider.

## Managed Agent directory

We list services that **host the agent loop and expose the agent through an API**. The provider runs the reasoning and tool loop, so your application can delegate a task without operating its own harness.

## How Claude separates the brain from the hands

The harness decides the next step, tools and sandboxes execute it, and the session keeps the history.
