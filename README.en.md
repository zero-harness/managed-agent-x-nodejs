> 🔥 **It’s 2027. You’re tuning the ReAct loop in your agent harness. The team next door just got its first PR from a cloud agent.**
>
> The loop takes a few lines. The hard part comes at 2 a.m. Your agent just filed a ticket and the connection dropped. Would you hit retry?

## How much code should it take to switch agents?

**Our goal is one config change to send the same task to Kimi instead of Claude.** We’re designing a common SDK for Java, Python, and Node.js to submit work and collect results. If your task needs stream recovery or human approval, the SDK will tell you which providers support it.

## Why use a managed agent?

A managed harness keeps track of the current task and runs code in an isolated sandbox. Attach a memory store and a new session can reuse project conventions without asking you to explain them again.

## How Meituan CatPaw separates planning from execution

The CatPaw harness plans each step and selects a tool. Sandboxes isolate code execution and file operations, while server tools run independently. The session queue records events so the harness can rebuild its context after a restart.
